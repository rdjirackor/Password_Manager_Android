Use Story

This application serves as a Password Manager. It will allows users to securely store their passwords and associated details such as usernames and email addresses for future use. 

When the app is opened for the first time, the user isprom pted to create a master password. This master password is required to access the app in subsequent uses. If the master password is ever lost, the userwill lose access to the stored passwords. This measure ensures the integrity and security of the saved passwords, preventing unauthorized access to the app.

Once the user successfully accesseds the app, all previously saved passwords are displayed. The user also has the option to delete all passwords in the settings section by confirming the deletion in a dialog box. Additionally,the user can tchange the master password using the provided option in the spinner section.
